# COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard (Tableau)

## Project Context

Effective visual analytics are crucial for communicating complex health data to professionals, decision-makers, and the public. This Tableau project translates global COVID-19 statistics into actionable, easy-to-understand visuals, supporting informed decisions about pandemic response and public health strategy.

## Executive Summary

This dashboard uses real COVID-19 case and death data to:

- Track and compare infection rates across countries and continents.
- Visualize global death tolls and infection percentages over time.
- Highlight key trends and disparities in COVID-19’s impact, enabling targeted analysis and resource allocation.


## Geographic hotspots, target countries for intervention.

- Infection rates varied widely; European countries saw higher infection percentages compared to many parts of Asia and Africa. Geographic hotspots and disparities are clearly visible.

## Trend growth, timing of surges, differences by country

- The United States experienced rapid and sustained growth in infection rate, surpassing 19%. India’s infection rate rose more slowly, reaching about 1.27%. Timing of surges and country-level differences in pandemic trajectory are highlighted.

## Regional impact, support planning and vaccine distribution.

- Europe and North America saw the highest total death counts, indicating severe impact and need for substantial healthcare resources. Oceania and Africa reported markedly lower totals.

## Overall pandemic scope, death percentage metric for high-level review.

- There were 150 million total cases and 3.18 million deaths, resulting in a global death percentage of 2.11%. This snapshot outlines the overall severity and scale of the pandemic.

  ## Data Analysis Approach

- **Data Integration:** Combined case, death, population data from multiple COVID-19 datasets.
- **Tableau Visualizations:** Built global maps, trend lines, bar charts, and KPI tables for interactive exploration.
- **Business Metrics:** Focused on percent of population infected, death rate, and absolute totals for regional comparisons.

## Next Steps

- Add vaccine rollout and recovery rate data for holistic reporting.
- Incorporate filters for dynamic exploration by time and region.
- Expand to socio-economic and hospital capacity metrics for deeper impact analysis.
